Homework #4- 

* First I wrote the HTML with the help of YouTube and W3 schools website. 

* I made my site to be responsive to any user that is using it on any screen size from small to large. 

* I decided to make a timed trivia game with 5 questions and 20 seconds to start 


* The second phase was to write the JS file. I kept missing variables and worked on getting them to propperly allign with the rest of the code so that the functions would work properly.

* The timer was hard to figure out. It kept going into negative time. My tutor helepd me replace the negative time with "No time left"
